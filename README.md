# Speed Typing Test

Welcome to the **Speed Typing Test**, a terminal-based typing game designed to measure and improve your typing speed, accuracy, and consistency. This project uses Python and the `curses` library to create a dynamic and interactive text-based user interface.

## Features
- **Random Text Snippets**: Each test presents a randomly selected line of text to type.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Highlights correct and incorrect characters as you type.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and streak (consecutive correct keystrokes).
- **High Score Tracker**: Keeps track of your best WPM score during the session.
- **Time-Limited Mode**: Challenge yourself with a 60-second time limit.
- **Pause/Resume**: Take a break when needed and resume without losing progress.
